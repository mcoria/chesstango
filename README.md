# Overview
ChessTango exemplifies the practical application of object-oriented design patterns within a board game context: a chess engine.

The majority of these patterns have been extensively outlined in the GoF book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)". This book is particularly recommended for beginner programmers. Over time, I've consistently kept a copy of this book on hand for easy reference.

It's important to note that while this project draws heavily from the patterns described in the GoF book, there are instances where unique patterns are employed. These exceptional cases are explicitly identified, along with references to external sources that elucidate their concepts.

It's worth clarifying that the objective of this project isn't to incorporate every conceivable design pattern present within the domain. Rather, I've selectively adopted patterns that aptly address specific challenges posed by the task.

While I've certainly taken performance considerations into account, the predominant non-functional priority remains the precise and coherent implementation of design patterns.

[Patterns Index](PatternIndex.md) provides a non-exhaust list of the patterns that have been used.

# Usage

## Chess GUI with UCI support
1. Download ChessTango binary distribution
2. Install a chess GUI with UCI support. For instance [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
3. Load ChessTango into the GUI


## Lichess BOT
If you prefer to play on-line you can challenge [chesstango_bot](https://lichess.org/@/chesstango_bot).
For the moment Standard time-controlled (Bullet/Blitz/Rapid) games are acceptable.
