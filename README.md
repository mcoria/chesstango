This project demonstrates the implementation of Object-oriented design patterns in a classical board game: chess.

Most of the patterns applied in this project are described in more detail by GoF book (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)). You should read this book especially if you are a beginner programmer. As the years go by, I always keep a copy near to me for reference.

There are special cases where patterns applied in this project are not described by GoF book, I explicitly mention those cases and the bibliography references that describe them.

By no means does the list of applied patterns is exhaustive, instead, I've used only those patterns that helped me to solve specific situations.

Although performance is taken into consideration, this is not the top non-functional priority, good design patterns implementation is preferred.
